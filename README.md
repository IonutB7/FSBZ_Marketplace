# FSBZ_Marketplace
The application is a simplified marketplace for a fictional shooter game: First Strike: Battle Zone (FS: BZ). Within it, users can exchange and buy / sell items with the store, which facilitates these operations through the application and which retains a small profit as a result of each exchange made.
